Methodology

1.Creating dataset
		1.Record(why 1 channel?)
		2.Labeling


		we cant process audio files directly, 
		We need to convert them to a proper readable format.
		So to feed them to CNN
		we convert it to a fixed size vector
		MFCC
		
2.Encoding dataset
		MFCC-
		fixed size vectors
		image like data
		extracts important features of speech
		discards noises

		But Why not others
		Why MFCC
		Results and calculations show that MFCC
		algorithm provides better result in terms of efficiency and accuracy comparison
		with other algorithm. 

		+
		It applies the Mel-frequency scaling, which is perceptual scale that helps to simulate the way human ear works. It corresponds to better resolution at low frequencies and less at high.

3.Saving the MFCC of all the files to a numpy file. Because MFCC is calculated only once

MFCC works(FPELDT)
frame
estimate power
melfilter bank for energy
take log of energy
take DCT of the logs
take 13-2 coff
