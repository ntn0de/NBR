Discussion
----------------
Why CNN

Because CNN is specially used for image processing . Other RNN are heavy and complex and used
for complex calculations like predicting the sequence. Since we treat the audio signals as
images and we dont have to predict the sequence, Cnn is used.

Because of a very limited dataset, the accuracy of the recognition is less and we are getting
many inaccurate results.
